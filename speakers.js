Or think of the ethical issues if you‚Äôre programming IoT devices that spy on users and report back to the company. The technology we create affects people‚Äôs lives. We need to be aware of how much power we‚Äôve been given and start taking responsibility for what we build."

	"talk": "npm started out as a back-end tool for node.js developers writing server-side applications, but has become the tool of choice for front-end developers writing rich web applications. More than 80% of npm users are writing front-end code! This was a big change, so npm 5 was a big change to meet the needs of this new type of user. Now with npm 6, we‚Äôre refining that focus. This talk covers best practices for npm 6, including ways to dramatically improve your build times, how to use our new security features, and talk about what‚Äôs coming up for npm. In the second half, I cover what npm knows about JavaScript developers based on our survey of over 16,000 developers, what that means for the future of JavaScript, and the tooling and language choices the data suggests you should make as a developer today."

	"talk": "This talk will focus on uses for service workers, with special focus on Offline First and intermittent connectivity. Intermittent internet connection is something many people in the United States face, and it‚Äôs a huge hurdle to complete simple tasks like finding a bank balance ‚Äì or even more important tasks like searching for employment.\nIn a world divided by those who are connected, and those who aren‚Äôt, developers are in a unique position to help by writing apps with an Offline First focus. This particular talk focuses on using service workers to improve a user‚Äôs experience when connection is lost.\nService workers cache assets like HTML pages, pictures and even JavaScript files within the user‚Äôs browser. Once the assets are cached, the browser will load directly from the cache making the entire loading process faster. Even better, because the assets are already in the browser, the page will load without an Internet connection!\nThis talk will introduce service workers, explore use cases, and teach the audience how to implement service workers in their apps. We‚Äôll also touch on other great features of service workers like background sync and push notifications."

	"talk": "Developers want to write better, faster, safer code. They want to do it quickly, consistently, and happily.\nThe problem is we‚Äôve chosen the wrong tools. We obsess over the wrong metrics. We fetishize the structure and organization of the enemy with ‚Äúclean code‚Äù. ‚ÄúClean code‚Äù promised a future of fun and flexibility but results only in another master, vying for your precious time and attention.\nI‚Äôve fought for ‚Äúclean code‚Äù my 10 years as a developer. For 10 years I lost and kept losing to this monster I was creating. I was taking my team with me. Now I empower devs and designers in the war against ‚Äúclean code‚Äù. I want developers and designers to win and keep winning.\nAfter identifying the enemy, I‚Äôll demonstrate the shape a component takes when ‚Äúclean code‚Äù is dogma. I‚Äôll then write the same component as hot-garbage. I‚Äôll show everyone how to create and compose in a way that prepares for the future but doesn‚Äôt bother to predict it.\nThe talk will be very practical and entertaining intro to a topic better known as ‚Äúcomposite component design‚Äù."

	"talk": "The goal of this talk is to show a basic introduction to serverless web apps without needing knowledge of other unnecessary dependencies or advanced devops expertise.\nI‚Äôll be using vanilla JavaScript and Netlify Functions (a simple, but powerful wrapper around AWS Lambda), to build Snowmaha, a simple web app that displays whether or not it is currently snowing in Omaha.\nYou can‚Äôt use Ajax to connect to a third-party api because of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Scripting). This means that building Snowmaha using only JavaScript is impossible unless some server-side code handles the request to the third-party api. Someone with above-average devops knowledge could setup a Lamda function and enable CORS for your site, but most people aren‚Äôt interested in learning how to use AWS Lamda, and why should they be? It has a horribly complex UX! Netlify Functions simplifies the process and sets up CORS for you. Now your site can make an Ajax request through Functions to Lamda and all of a sudden developers that only know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are building ‚Äúserverless‚Äù applications with the power of server-side functionality."

	"talk": "According to the principle of least astonishment, things should operate in a way that‚Äôs predictable. The collaborative nature between designer and developer is necessary for a universally usable system. The designer creates something that is visually predictable while the developer creates something programatically predictable.\nAs web developers we like to think that our hard work creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is what makes our sites so great. Then we realize the reality: all our hard work is really just a request saying, ‚ÄúPlease, Mr. Browser, can you make this website do all the cool stuff I‚Äôve designed here?‚Äù When the user‚Äôs browser receives your web page and all of its assets, your control of the situation entirely ceases. How your site really looks and operates is entirely in the hands of the browser.\nIn this talk, Karl provides important technical insight into accessibility by describing the interactions between HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript, the DOM, the BOM, Accessibility APIs and Assistive Technologies."

	"talk": "When we ‚Äúview source‚Äù our modern web applications, the code looks nothing like what we originally wrote. At a minimum, it‚Äôs gone through linting, transpilation, obfuscation, minification, and bundling. And in order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript available in our modern evergreen browsers.\nHowever, when web development was in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let‚Äôs take a walk down memory lane (or have a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them."

	"talk": "Reasoning about asynchronous code can be hard if you don‚Äôt understand the mechanics. It often trips up programmers with deep experience in other languages when they try their hand at client or server-side JavaScript. But, asynchronous JavaScript isn‚Äôt as hard as it seems once you learn a few simple rules about how it works. In this talk, we‚Äôll dive into the mechanics of concepts that you might have had a chance to full grok.\nLet‚Äôs dispel this confusion once and for all. We‚Äôll explore some metaphors that illustrate the difference between how synchronous and asynchronous code execute. In a 30-minute tour de force, we‚Äôll dive into essential concepts like the call stack and the event loop to build a solid conceptual understanding of how the asynchronous model is implemented. We‚Äôll take a good hard look at a number of common patterns for writing asynchronous code in JavaScript. We‚Äôll start with listening for events on XMLHttpRequest before abstracting that mess with callbacks and promises. We‚Äôll pull back the curtain and see that async/await is really just a cocktail of promises and generators. Finally, we‚Äôll lightly touch upon some more boutique approaches like CSP and shooting messages back and forth between the main and worker threads."
